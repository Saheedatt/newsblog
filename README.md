# Newspaper Blog: Our Newspaper
In this project, I developed a fully functional newspaper blog. It has responsive design with functionalities for displaying news articles and a toggleable sidebar for mobile view.
    The goal wss to create a user-friendly interface with two pages: one for displaying all news and another for selected news. I went a little further to display news based on selected categories. I incorporated a search feature, a navigation bar with a logo link, and a footer with link to my github repository for this project.
